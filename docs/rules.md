# 1. Be Respectful

Disagreement and debate is very much encouraged here. But please try to refrain from ad hominem attacks. Baseless motive-questioning and bad faith accusations against others will not be tolerated.

# 2. No Doxing

**No posting financial information (e.g. Credit Card numbers), private phone numbers, or home street addresses!**

No posting others' private email addresses, connected social media accounts (e.g. Facebook profiles), etc.

# 3. No Real-World Profanity

Do not use real-world profanity here. *Wheel of Time* profanity is not just allowed, but very much encouraged.

# 4. No NSFW content

Discussion of mature topics as they pertain to *The Wheel of Time* are permitted, provided that they are handled tactfully and appropriately.

No NSFW or sensual content of any kind. [Contact the mods](contact) with any uncertainty.

# 5. No Harassment or Brigading

Do *not* organize activity against individuals, organizations, or websites. Posting links is more than welcome.

# 6. Redact Identifying Information

Redact usernames and real names of non-public figures. GitHub usernames of other users of the *Dragonsworn* Discussions forum or the *The Band of the Red Hand* Discord do not need to be redacted. Other Discord usernames should be redacted, but nicknames do not need to be redacted even if they're from other Discords.

# 7. No Low-Effort Posts

Specifically:

1. No posts about your ban from a WoT subreddit.
2. No posts about Reddit, YouTube, Discord, or other social media drama in general. Posts about bans of entire subreddits, Discord servers, or YouTube channels (etc.) are allowed.
3. No reposts of anything that has been posted in the past month.
4. No mere screenshots of critic or review aggregator sites without permission.

There will be exceptions to this rule. If you feel your post or topic qualifies, [contact the mods](contact).
