***Breaking of the Wheel, The*** - November 18th, 2021

***Coat, The*** - Rand's brown coat from the show. You know the one. Credit to **litreofcola#4855** for harping on it until he posted [a pic](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/911213135468302387/911256250937933904/20211118_235853.jpg) prior to the TBOTRH Discord mods watching the show and the reason became apparent.

***Creator, The*** - Robert Jordan, the author of *The Wheel of Time*

***Gigashad*** - Shad of [Shadiversity](https://www.youtube.com/user/shadmbrooks) and [Knight's Watch](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCubCObW93mbrIFoxwNamFFw) YouTube channels and accompanying [Discord](https://discord.gg/shadiverse). So called for actually critiquing the show and not giving everything a positive spin to pander to the show creators, and [for calling out r/whitecloaks for doing the same](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umIwqLtv2es).

***Griefing the Nipples*** - Synonym for [Jumping the Shark](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/JumpingTheShark). Credit to **Nonesuch#9008** for coining the phrase.

***Mesaarah*** [/mɛssæ.ɹə/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=m%C9%9Bss%C3%A6.%C9%B9%C9%99) - Official "[book expert](https://twitter.com/sarahenakamura)" for the Wheel of Prime. So named for supporting and defending the Wheel of Prime's desecrations.

***Nargo*** [/nɑɹgo/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=n%C9%91%C9%B9go) - The Trolloc that abducted Nynaeve in WoP 1.1. [Facetiously coined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKUXg6hzkNo) based on him sharing iris color with WoP Narg by **Dain Bornhald#5816**.

***Paitrrr*** [/ˈpeɪtɚɚɚ/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%CB%88pe%C9%AAt%C9%9A%C9%9A%C9%9A) *(aka Marrrillllllin Gemalllphin [/ˈmæɹɹɹĭllllllɪn ɡɛmɑlllfɪn/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%CB%88m%C3%A6%C9%B9%C9%B9%C9%B9%C4%ADllllll%C9%AAn%20%C9%A1%C9%9Bm%C9%91lllf%C9%AAn)* - [/u/chtorrr](https://np.reddit.com/u/chtorrr), the power-abusing Reddit mod that harassed r/whitecloaks for several months before effectively shutting down the subreddit. Would say things like "this is not up for debate" in response to requests for evidence of accusations. Was caught [abusing their admin privileges](https://imgur.com/a/EAGu2K6) to modify 2022's [r/place](https://reddit.com/r/place) pixels without a cooldown mere days later. Called Paitrrr because they seem to be an inept servant of the Shadow. Called Marrrillllllin Gemalllphin because they seem to be a cat lady.

***Rafeland*** [/ɹeɪflænd/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%C9%B9e%C9%AAfl%C3%A6nd) - Refers to the world of the Amazon show adaptation. Contrast with Randland, which refers to the westlands (and Aiel Waste?) in the books. Credit to [/u/danjvelker](https://reddit.com/u/danjvelker) for bringing the term to our attention.

***Raginor*** [/räɡɪnɔɹ/](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=r%C3%A4%C9%A1%C9%AAn%C9%94%C9%B9) - [Rafe Judkins](https://twitter.com/rafejudkins). So named for creating a show as abominable as anything Aginor ever created from a source material as good as anything Aginor ever mutated. Credit to **Abyssea#6077** for coining the term.

***Showsworn*** *(aka Showspawn, Showsaken, Rafists, Rafesworn, Darkfans)* - Amazon and/or Raginor fanboys who compulsively defend the show, particularly those who claim things that clearly contradict the books are actually true to the books or superior to the books. Note: does not apply to any and all of those who like or enjoy the show or praise some aspect, only those who have forsworn the Light in their delusions.

***Wheel of Prime*** *(aka WoP, Waste of Time)* - Amazon "adaptation" of *The Wheel of Time*.

***YAHTSYB*** - *You Are Here Too Strongly, Young Bull*. Frequent refrain from Hopper towards Perrin in *Tel'aran'rhiod*. Used by fans to warn away those who haven't read far enough to be unspoiled in a particular subreddit, channel, website, etc.
